WELCOME TO PROJECT CAIA


1. Install python 3.6 or 3.7 max. Tensorflow currently has some issue with python 3.8

2. Setup necessary virtualenv 
Point to the python 3.6 or 3.7 executable for the virtualenv

virtualenv --system-site-packages -p C:\Users\13129\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\python.exe ./venv-project-caia

3. Now install rasa packages.

rasa init


Process:

-Conversation design
most frequent conversation patterns.

-define the intents, provide some examples of how the users may say that specific thing
and label the entities

- configure pipelines 
you can use preconfigured pipelines with less training data. 
it will provide faster model but more generic data as compared to domain specific data

the pipelines are just shortcut for full components which are responsible for diff processing steps. Understand the steps
-> SpacyNLP
-> SpacyTokenizer
-> SpacyFeaturizer
-> RegexFeaturizer
-> CRFEntityExtractor
-> EntitySynonymMapper
-> SklearnIntentClassifier

- rasa train nlu ---> from config.yml


-- handle class imbalance -> Balance Batching Strategy
-- implement custom spell checker to handle typos in custom pipelines.

4. dialogue management using machine learning. 

5. setup custom actions

6. slots => memory variables that can be derived from the nlu model.
slot types= text, bool, categorical, float, list, unfeaturized


7. important hyperparameters for dialogue management.
max_history
data_augmentation
